### Requirements
---
In order to run the fullstack you will require Docker to be installed on your machine, and WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)((If you are on Windows)).

Instructions for enabling WSL can be found here: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install 

You can find the download for Docker Desktop here:
https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/


Once you have Docker Desktop installed and open, do as below:

### Startup Instructions

---

- Open a new terminal 
- Navigate to the root directory of this project, containing the `docker-compose.yml` file
- Enter the following command: `docker-compose up --build -d`

At this point docker will begin spinning up 3 containers for the `api`, `db` & `fe` components of the project.

- Wait for the logs to report that the three projects have started, as below: 
```
[+] Running 3/3
 - Container interview-mongo-1 Started
 - Container interview-api-1   Started
 - Container interview-app-1   Started
```
- Open your preferred browser and navigate to localhost:3000 (http://localhost:3000/)

---
When you're finished, type `docker-compose down`, or close docker-desktop on your machine.
